## **Inspiration**
ðŸŽµ On the first day of Christmas... My true love sent to me... A link to an awesome website called **12-days-of-christmas-with-us** that gets everyone into the Christmas Spirit in just 12 Days ðŸŽµ

## **What It Does**
* Let's you plan your Christmas days
* **Movies**: A Christmas movie a day brings Santa your way
* **Recipes**: Keep your tummy in the festivity with our recommended recipes for each day
* **Songs**: Play our recommended Christmas songs right from our website* **Customize**: After signing up and logging in, you can customize your movie, recipe and song preferences for each day according to your liking
* **Notes**: there's even a virtual notepad to capture your Christmas-y thoughts or keep track of your Christmas Todo List (making sure you don't forget to buy that gift for Uncle Tim!)

## **How It Was Built**
* ``` Flask ```
* ``` HTML and CSS ```
* ``` SQLite ```
* ``` Heroku ```
* ``` Git ```
## **How To Run It**
